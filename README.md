# "Un-Named Game"
For the past 2 years, I've only programmed games in C++, this time I decided to go even lower and program a **MULTIPLAYER** Game in C without any IDE Installed. By the end of this project, I'm expecting to learn the following skills.

## Goals
- UDP Sockets
- Encrypting Socket Messages
- Allowing Multiple Players to join the game
- Memory Management in C (Improve on this one)
- Learn to Deploy a UDP Server to DigitalOcean*
